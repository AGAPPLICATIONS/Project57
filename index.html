         <p>
         Soccer/Football is one of my hobbies as it allows me to destress , to enjoy and be competitive without a limit.This allows me to be happier and focus more and thus get more done.It also allows me to express myself and to be as creative as I like and do whatever I like, all through a single ball.It allows me to expand my horizons and grow as a human , morally,mentally and physically.It makes me more confident, and I can be at peace when I am playing the sport.It is, in summary , a hobby that allows me to be myself,and it makes me,me.
